# Menu

I made this menu with `a[href="#menu"]` and `:target`.

The menu is animated with CSS.

It works without JavaScript and without CSS.

Should work from IE9.

`Array.prototype.forEach`
Used for loops

`querySelector`
Used for element selection

`requestAnimationFrame`
Used for high performing animations

`matchMedia`
Used for small screen menu's
